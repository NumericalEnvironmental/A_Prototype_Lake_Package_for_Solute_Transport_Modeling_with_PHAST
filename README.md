# A_Prototype_Lake_Package_for_Solute_Transport_Modeling_with_PHAST

This Python script provides a limited groundwater-lake water interaction modeling capability to the U.S. Geological Survey’s PHAST reactive transport model. Its features include balancing water flows (assuming steady-state hydrologic conditions) and computing the resulting mixing ratios between surface water and groundwater influxes to the lake as well as the extent of evapo-concentration. These capabilities represent solute transport-modeling enhancements to the leaky boundary condition keyword block that already exists among PHAST’s features. More details are available on my blog, including an example application [link pending].
The script requires the NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy libraries. The text-based input files needed to run the script include the following:
* FinalState.csv (or equivalent) – consists of columnar formatted grid data listing x and y coordinates, along with elevation (z), among other data, delineating the digitized land surface. For the included synthetic terrain based-example, “FinalState.csv” is the output file generated by an erosional sculpting model I had created previously [link pending].
* fluxes.txt – evaporation and precipitation rates (flux per unit area), groundwater inflows and outflows with respect to the lake, and surface water inflows and outflows.
* grid.txt – discretization constraints for the lake with reference to x-y coordinates. Note that this is not required to coincide with those of either the digitized land surface or the posited PHAST model.

Example transport and chemistry input files used for the PHAST lake demonstration problem are also included.

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the code useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
